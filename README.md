### Hi there, I'm Saul 👋

- 🌊 I’m currently a front-end developer building web apps for water usage insights at [Conservation Labs](https://conservationlabs.com/).
- 🌱 I code a lot in Vue.js and love to use the [Quasar framework](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar). My roots are in React. 
- 🧠 I've recently started sharing my experiences and knowledge on [Medium](https://medium.com/@saulgraves). 
- 🧑‍💻 I like to code towards [component driven UIs](https://www.componentdriven.org/) and obsess over reusability.
- ☕️ 🐉 💫 The best part of my day is my morning pour over coffee, I love Studio Ghibli movies, and yes I believe Jar Jar was a sith.
- 📫 You can reach me at graves.saul@gmail.com

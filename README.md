### Hi there, I'm Saul 👋

- 🌊 I’m currently a front-end developer building web apps for water usage insights at [Conservation Labs](https://conservationlabs.com/).
- 🌱 I code a lot in Vue.js and love to use the [Quasar framework](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar). My roots are in React. 
- 🧠 I've recently started sharing my experiences and knowledge on [Medium](https://medium.com/@saulgraves). 
- 🧑‍💻 I like to code for modularity and reusability. I've recently developed an obsession over consistent web design 😬
- ☕️ The best part of my day is my morning pour over coffee
- 🐉 I love Studio Ghibli movies
